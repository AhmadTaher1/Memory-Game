🧠 Memory Game
A fun and interactive memory game built using JavaScript as part of my ITI course.
The game tests your memory skills by flipping cards and matching pairs while keeping track of time.

🚀 Features:
🎮 Start Screen: A cute welcome page before the game begins.
✍️ Player Name Entry: Enter your name before playing.
⏳ Timer: Tracks how long you take to complete the game.
🃏 Card Flipping: Click to reveal images and find matching pairs.
🎉 Completion Message: Displays your completion time after you win.
